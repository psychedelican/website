		WHO AM I? <font color="pink">(YOU ARE HERE)</font></h3>
		<hr>
		<p>I'm a 19 year old musician from Saint Louis, Missouri.<br>
		I play guitar but I've recently been venturing into<br>
		electronic music because it allows me to make full-sounding <br>
		songs on my own.<br>
		It doesn't really matter what I'm using to make a song <br>
		I just enjoy the process and have been doing so most days<br>
		for about 4 years. <p>
		<br>
		
		<p>More than anything I'm interested in making music that is <br>
		completely unique to myself that doesn't try to sound like someone else.<br>
		Almost all of my songs are completely personal but I write them vague<br>
		enough so that anybody can relate.<br>
		If you have any questions about the specific meaning of some of my lyrics<br>
		just shoot me an email or get to me on Twitter or Instagram or wherever</p>
		
		<p>if you're a listener thank you and if you're a friend I love you</p>
