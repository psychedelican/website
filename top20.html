		<font color="green"><h1>this is a constantly evolving list of the top 20 songs of all time.<br>
			THIS LIST IS NOT OPINION and if you tell me I'm wrong<br></font>
		<font color="orange">I dunno just watch ur back</h1></font>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Mx1Q7-oH8" target="_blank">#1 NUSRAT FATEH ALI KHAN - Akhiyaan Udeek Diyan(LIVE)</a></h3>
		<p>absolutely crazy. I try to listen 3 times a day. My song "Who You Are"<br> was heavily inspired by listening to his qawwalis.</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfmmc7lA72U" target="_blank">#2 GEORGE HARRISON - Run of the Mill</a></h3>
		<p>people say this song is about the Beatles but I prefer to think<br> it's about Jesus. "...another day for you to realise me or send<br>me down again"</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH0l7nIMfw0" target="_blank">#3 JIM SULLIVAN - U.F.O</a></h3>
		<p>this song is actually about Jesus. Makes me want to live on a<br> hot slab of rock in the desert<br>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I4L0ZDp5rg" target="_blank">#4 WU-TANG CLAN - Shame on a Nigga</a></h3>
		<p>accidentally sing this in public sometimes.<br>
			great workout song.<br>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9gK2fOq4MY" target="_blank">#5 TALKING HEADS - This Must Be The Place</a></h3>
		<p>Talking Heads only have 3 good songs<br></p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZTjFW2RYo" target="_blank">#6 DNA feat. SUZANNE VEGA - Tom's Diner</a></h3>
		<p>embedded in my brain from childhood I think it was in<br>
		a PS1 game or something</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EeF6jpTUws" target="_blank">#7 JIM REEVES - It is no secret what God can do</a></h3>
		<p>driving back home to STL from Michigan this song came on the radio.<br> thought it was much better than Elvis's version and<br>
		made me feel comfortable driving 110mph down the highway</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9gM-blNvdM" target="_blank">#8 SYD BARRETT - Late Night</a></h3>
		<p>inside me I feel alone and unreal<br></p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIRE6iw-ws4" target="_blank">#9 PETER BJORN AND JOHN - Young Folks</a></h3>
		<p>eternal hit<br></p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EixUHnxlTAs" target="_blank">#10 THE FAMILY JAMS - Ride Away!</a></h3>
		<p>wish I had a commune to make songs with probly will once<br>
		the social atmosphere becomes so bad people start searching<br>
		for community once they get bored of the internet</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgcgqkuruqA" target="_blank">#11 PHIL OCHS - I'm Tired</a></h3>
		<p>start out again with a smile on my face, to hide all the empty<br>and search for a friend</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07HBhKyp7Y" target="_blank">#12 MICHEL POLNAREFF - Love Me, Please Love Me</a></h3>
		<p>YES</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_5gl9DHfs" target="_blank">#13 ALPHATAURUS - La mente vola</a></h3>
		<p>wait till they start singing</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD7SvXmjf3U" target="_blank">#14 THE ASSOCIATION - Along Comes Mary</a></h3>
		<p>back when weed was craaazzyyyyyy maaannnn wooah ur tellin' me<br> you smoke that green stuff??? Whattt??? PSA: weed is a completely uncool drug<br>if you want to look cool I suggest doing heroin or meth. Heroin if you want to appear cool cool meth<br>
		if you want to appear crazy cool. But either way you gotta lift<br>
		and look good meth will help with lifing so that's probably your<br>
	best bet, unless ur already in shape in which case do heroin and become<br>
a sinewy rock god</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HwdNkzYq0" target="_blank">#15 JOHN FAHEY - Sligo River Blues</a></h3>
		<p>crazy iconic</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eoKc7XPc0Q" target="_blank">#16 DAVE BIXBY - I Have Seen Him</a></h3>
		<p>Bixby had a style that I'd never heard (even as a heavy <br>psych-folk listener) and I was absolutely blown away by his Ode to<br> Quetzalcoatl album</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9muzyOd4Lh8" target="_blank">#15 THE MOODY BLUES - Nights in White Satin</a></h3>
		<p>only Moody Blues song I like</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yvAgmRU49c" target="_blank">#16 CHARLES MANSON- Eyes of a Dreamer</a></h3>
		<p>If you think liking Manson's music is "weird" or "oooohh oh my<br> god why does he like a murderrerrs musssiiicc eeww" ur a fkn<br>milquetoast ass bitch get hit by a car please</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MboUz0fJb6w" target="_blank">#17 PINK FLOYD - Candy And A Currant Bun</a></h3>
		<p>I liiike-uh to see you run</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U4TmEUH2w0" target="_blank">#18 KLAATU - Doctor Marvello </a></h3>
		<p>only the original mix of this song would I consider in my top<br> 20. If you hear a version where "if that is all you want" is<br> NOT whispered than you have the wrong version</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JkvajIYuoU" target="_blank">#19 WEST COAST POP ART EXPERIMENTAL BAND - Eighteen Is Over the Hill </a></h3>
		<p>only reason this group wasn't as big as The Beatles is because<br>their name was too long</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH0JY0DY-gQ" target="_blank">#20 THE INCREDIBLE STRING BAND - First Girl I Loved </a></h3>
		<p>there are two versions of this song, this one and the Chelsea<br> version. This one is better cause it's in a better key and the<br> delivery is better. Highest quality version I could find<br> on youtube</p>
