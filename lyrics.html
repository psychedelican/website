<h1><font color="blue">1. That Can Kill You</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>need<br>
what I need<br>
I cannot live without it<br>
but that's just me<br>
I'm cold<br>
so cold<br>
they have a right to keep me<br>
or they can let me go<br>
all the other bridges take the traffic<br>
never really thought that I would make it through<br>
almost stuck in indecision<br>
but that can kill you<br>
how <br>
how high<br>
if I want to jump in<br>
if I want to die<br>
good<br>
looks so good<br>
the people talk about me<br>
like I think they should<br>
all the other bridges take the traffic<br>
never really thought that I would make it through<br>
almost stuck in indecision<br>
but that can kill you<br>
nevermore, I'm wonderful<br>
remind me, my environment was overwhelming<br>
but less concerning than the stuff I saw on TV<br>
bread and sugar, "there that's better"<br>
lucky that I grew up healthy<br>
new computer, I looked right through her<br>
when the images rub off then<br>
all the other bridges take the traffic<br>
never really thought that I would make it through<br>
almost stuck in indecision<br>
but that can kill you</p>

<h1><font color="blue">2. paradise earth</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>It's not that hard<br>
to fall apart<br>
and break off<br>
light the pieces of the puzzle<br>
why? <br>
cause<br>
I <br>
you remind me of<br>
an image I forgot<br>
I don't get it<br>
I don't get it<br>
I don't care<br>
where we go<br>
my head is fine<br>
and if we walk slow<br>
we could be<br>
focussed on the theme of things<br>
now that we are<br>
trapped in time<br>
an hour strong<br>
the end's not clear<br>
I want to give up<br>
but that's not the <br>
way you want me to be<br>
and it's not fair <br>
you had it all<br>
I'm down so low <br>
I can't begin to<br>
play the game<br>
guess I'll break the rules<br>
guess I'll break the rules<br>
I can't let slip<br>
I'm out of it<br>
therapist said I shouldn't be under the fire<br>
why?<br>
cause<br>
it <br>
would restructure<br>
the pain<br>
and make it twice as bad<br>
I don't get it<br>
I don't get it<br>
I don't care<br>
where we go<br>
my head is fine<br>
and if we walk slow<br>
we could be<br>
focussed on the theme of things<br>
now that we are<br>
trapped in time<br>
an hour strong<br>
the end's not clear<br>
I want to give up<br>
but that's not the <br>
way you want me to be<br>
and it's not fair <br>
you had it all<br>
I'm down so low <br>
I can't begin to<br>
play the game<br>
guess I'll break the rules</p>
		
<h1><font color="blue">3. Who You Are</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>take a thread, and bind my ankles so I can go home instead<br>
to stay with you forever and it's in what you said<br>
heard you talk, and when you come from the sky to relieve us all<br>
it won't be mistaken<br>
steal the whole of my heart<br>
who you are<br>
know who you are<br>
know who you are<br>
breathing fast, and beauty isn't only in the way you act<br>
always you remind me that I need to relax<br>
who you are<br>
know who you are<br>
know who you are<br>
life goes on, but sometimes I feel I would be much better gone<br>
it's not my decision so I just put it off<br>
who you are<br>
know who you are</p>

<h1><font color="blue">4. Reflection</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>now my eyes are weary<br>
cause everyone is worried around me<br>
it can't be hard<br>
it's not that hard<br>
to hug and say goodbye<br>
stay out I'm shutting off<br>
scared of reflection<br>
I would like to be forever<br>
more interruptedness out in the dead open air<br>
was after all decided I that it don't mean nothin'<br>
so meet my one condition<br>
and kill the apparition inside me<br>
we can't just quit<br>
get over it<br>
and rip the face off<br>
stay out I'm shutting off<br>
scared of reflection<br>
"cemetary asphalt cracked in sun!" cried marianne<br>
wait for husband<br>
ouch the skin and bone turn grey and white<br>
losing the red of living<br>
lifeless and cold tear drops staining the earth<br>
wasting all your precious feelings<br>
you see all the suffering at once and realize it don't mean nothin'<br>
stay out I'm shutting off<br>

<h1><font color="blue">5. I can be no one</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>you broke the ceiling now my feelings will never be the same<br>
the wedding cake was on my birthday, I swallowed the ring<br>
people behind me in the lobby turn around and say "hey!"<br>
the funded a-holes dropped the mail now I can't do my job<br>
pick up the phone the dial tone is really pissing me off<br>
the bloody tissue in the bathroom seems to call out me<br>
I wish you taught me how to eat right<br>
tough to stay in but you know I never sleep through the night<br>
the lucky people of the future got it beautiful<br>
make<br>
make me happy<br>
don't make me mad<br>
I won't be sad<br>
if that's what you decided<br>
do what you like<br>
you're not my slave<br>
and I can be no one<br>
if that's what you want me to be<br>
the pope had warned me, got too horny but I couldn't help myself<br>
and with my goosebumps his good news was we're going to hell<br>
people remind at the party "there's still time to be saved!"<br>
punched through a mirror now I'm clearer on just where I stand<br>
I would have cared, if not for you there, the cuts on my hand<br>
and I kept walking on the carpet, and the carpet was stained<br>
I got my faith up in the big guy<br>
but I still wonder if you've wandered in to listen to my<br>
constant good-doing, if I knew it then I woulda said <br>
make <br>
make me happy<br>
don't make me mad<br>
I won't be sad<br>
if that's what you decide<br>
do what you like<br>
you're not my slave<br>
and I can be no one<br>
if that's what you want me to be<br>
yeah<br>
a yeah-ee yeah<br>
a yaeh-ee yeah-aa-uu-aa-uuh-oooh-ooo-ohee-ooh<br>
oh<br>
yeah<br>
a yeah-ee yeah<br>
a yaeh-ee yeah-aa-uu-aa-uuh-oooh-ooo-ohee-ooh<br>
oh<br>
make me happy<br>
don't make me mad<br>
I won't be sad<br>
if that's what you decide<br>
do what you like<br>
you're not my slave<br>
and I can be no one<br>
if that's what you want me to be</p>

<h1><font color="blue">6. lazy</font></h1>
<hr>			

<p> all the other guys got ladders that they climb<br>
but only if they saw it like I do<br>
open solid gates with bronze and copper plates<br>
above, leading with streets to run through<br>
and what they don't get<br>
I can't explain<br>
what makes them so different<br>
from me<br>
well, I'm in a daydream. Can't you tell?<br>
foolish people climb and do stuff with their time<br>
and don't name all the clouds that they could<br>
looking for yourself is better I can tell you<br>
cause I have for a while, and it's good<br>
having some fun<br>
I float up there with my friends<br>
I have no one<br>
ha<br>
but it's OK because I'm almost dead<br>
I'm gonna fall when this wears out<br>
but if I have wings and the sun, I'm fine<br>
never wonder, it's the right way to live or die<br>
in a minute that's the train come rushin' by<br>
just remembered where I was and I don't mind<br>
no no no no no no<br>
I look to my left and see a crystal bed<br>
with flowers, ornaments, and apples<br>
thank you for the gifts <br>
and all the ornaments<br>
I'll make sure I behave<br>
I'm grateful<br>
and what you don't get<br>
I can't explain<br>
what makes it so different<br>
to me<br>
well, I'm in a daydream. Can't you tell?</p>

<h1><font color="blue">7. pretty tonite</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>everyone's looking<br>
I see what they see<br>
you look pretty tonite<br>
you look pretty tonite<br>
you hold your head down<br>
act like it's nothing<br>
but you look pretty tonite<br>
you look pretty tonite<br>
you make my heart go<br>
you make my heart go<br>
you make my heart go<br>
you make my heart go<br>
you look pretty tonite<br>
you look pretty tonite<br>
but you'd look better with<br>
ME<br>
WITH ME<br>
what do I do?<br>
what can I do? <br>
what do I do to get you?<br>
what do I do? <br>
what can I do?<br>
what do I do to get you?<br>
I am the last forgotten person<br>
I make my bed up nice<br>
and if I jump off the Golden Gate Bridge<br>
I don't think you would cry<br>
you look pretty tonite<br>
you look pretty tonite</p>

<h1><font color="blue">8. is a hell</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>where were you when I was down?<br>
and empty, trying to find out something somehow<br>
to just hold on<br>
and now you're here<br>
if this had gone a separate way<br>
I might not have had a reason to stay<br>
but now you're here<br>
so just hold on<br>
the damage is done<br>
I told you<br>
that once is enough<br>
alone two<br>
is a hell<br>
is a hell<br>
by memory I held you there<br>
the doldrums, or panic in the air <br>
would shake me up<br>
you melt away<br>
I cried out loud, a simple sum<br>
arithmetic, my head spins and I feel numb<br>
you melt away<br>
you shake me up<br>
the damage is done<br>
I told you<br>
that once is enough<br>
alone two<br>
is a hell<br>
is a hell<br>
I saw you run but as a joke<br>
it would be funny but there's no way I could know<br>
just where you want your intentions to be<br>
I'd like to think you're a pure kind<br>
I'd like to think that I can see in your eyes<br>
intentions to be just what you want<br>
the damage is done<br>
I told you<br>
that once is enough<br>
alone two<br>
is a hell<br>

<h1><font color="blue">9. Another Stranger's House</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>I can't sleep<br>
if I don't get<br>
a little rest<br>
a little bit<br>
the death of me isn't it? <br>
that's what she said<br>
that's what she said<br>
oh<br>
I'd feel more happy here in a dream<br>
but I can't tell if it is<br>
and if it is<br>
can you help me? <br>
what I'm looking for<br>
I watched my hand open the door<br>
now I got the light of daydream<br>
and in another stranger's house<br>
I went walk around<br>
watching through the wall<br>
I'm not here at all<br>
weak heart<br>
you take me down<br>
I heard the screams<br>
I hate that sound<br>
and when apocalypse does come<br>
it won't be bad it will be fun<br>
because my thoughts, had enough<br>
a bit too much<br>
a little much<br>
oh<br>
I couldn't just give it up<br>
I wasn't done<br>
it wasn't done<br>
I lost myself out there in the dark<br>
kinda far<br>
kinda far<br>
so grab my neck, pull me in<br>
if you can<br>
do you need me? <br>
well I hope you do<br>
I saw myself, was so confused<br>
why?<br>
no mirror in my room<br>
and in another stranger's house<br>
I went walk around<br>
watching through the walls<br>
I'm not here at all<br>
soft will<br>
you take me to<br>
the hospital to get a room<br>
and when the doctor comes<br>
he'll give me pills and I'll be done<br>
it's over<br>
it's over<br>
it's over<br>
it's over<br>
and in another stranger's house<br>
I went walk around<br>
watching through the walls<br>
I'm not here at all</p>

<h1><font color="blue">11. mode eleven</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>any other thing would have been ok<br>
the straw fell on the back of a bit of a big day<br>
bad<br>
guess I should remind you<br>
saw the different towns<br>
yeah I went and looked<br>
saw the stupid titles of your favorite books<br>
that's it?<br>
all young adult fiction<br>
it goes right down underneath<br>
are you waiting for a flood?<br>
subconscious<br>
rain<br>
I am<br>
all the validation you could ever want<br>
won't spark your motivation you'd be better off without<br>
constant stimulus and<br>
patterns in your eyes you can never see<br>
put ideas in your mind without agency<br>
they can<br>
it's just advertising<br>
it goes right down underneath<br>
are you waiting for a flood? <br>
subsconscious<br>
rain<br>
I am<br>
david rockefeller had a heart attack<br>
he tried to take his money in a paper bag<br>
that's greed<br>
it did not float with him<br>
looking at the cover of a magazine<br>
the words above his head saying death is a bad thing<br>
shit<br>
didn't care to notice<br>
it goes right down underneath<br>
are you waiting for a flood<br>
subconscious<br>
rain<br>
I am</p>

<h1><font color="blue">12. I'm Alright</font></h1>
<hr>

<p>you want me to audition<br>
my stomach sank but overhead<br>
I saw the joke<br>
was right from God<br>
how can I a builder ant<br>
begin to ever understand<br>
the way it is<br>
it was from the start<br>
now baby I'll say<br>
you were not the secondary<br>
she was oddly ordinary<br>
made me see just where the problems are<br>
and while scratching my head I began to<br>
feel much better<br>
leading me through<br>
all the hell and heaven been so far<br>
and I'm alright<br>
I'm alright<br>
I'm alright<br>
love I think is just a try<br>
between a girl between a guy<br>
you hold my hand<br>
and I clutch yours<br>
sometimes it's not good enough<br>
an overwhelming lack of trust betrayed my heart<br>
but what for? <br>
now baby I say<br>
why was it so temporary?<br>
something in the window that she<br>
struggled with and decided enough<br>
there was nothing I could do so I guess<br>
I will have to stick to leaving<br>
burning all the bridges between us<br>
and I'm alright<br>
I'm alright<br>
I'm alright<br>
often hesitation gets the better of me<br>
choosing every letter of the words I try to write<br>
maybe I am not the best at being more sincere<br>
but is that all you want to see?<br>
somebody cry?<br>
well I'm alright<br>
I'm alright<br>
I'm alright<br>
I'm alright</p>
